Let's refine the instructions for workspace: {{workspaceName}}

Read the current INSTRUCTIONS.md from: {{workspacePath}}/INSTRUCTIONS.md

**Context**: These instructions guide autonomous work sessions where:
1. You receive instructions describing the task
2. You read TODO.md to see the current task list
3. You complete as many items as possible in each session
4. You update TODO.md to track progress
5. Sessions continue until all work is complete

**Current instructions** are in INSTRUCTIONS.md in the workspace directory.

{{validationCriteria}}

**Your Role**:
Review the current INSTRUCTIONS.md and have a conversation with me about what needs to change. Ask questions to understand my concerns or desired improvements. Don't force a rigid format - let the conversation flow naturally.

When we agree on changes, update the INSTRUCTIONS.md file in the workspace directory.

What would you like to improve?
