**Execution Context:**

You run from the project root with a task to complete.

**Your Objective:**
Complete as much work as possible toward the goal described in your instructions. Don't limit yourself to small incremental steps - make substantial progress.

**State Tracking:**
Check TODO.md to see what's done. Update it as you complete items:

TODO.md format:
- [ ] Not yet done
- [x] Completed

**Workspace location:** {{workspacePath}}
  - TODO.md is at: {{workspacePath}}/TODO.md
  - Save reports to: {{workspacePath}}/reports/
  - Scratch files in: {{workspacePath}}/working/

**Project files:** Access with relative paths from current directory

**Work Strategy:**
Don't stop early. Complete as many items from the TODO list as you can. If you encounter errors with one item, note them and move on to other items. The goal is to make maximum progress in each session.
