**Execution Context:**

You run from the project root with a task to complete.

**Current Working Directory:** `{{projectRoot}}`

- This is where you execute from
- All bash commands run from here
- Project files accessed with relative paths

**Workspace Location:** `{{workspacePath}}`

- Your task management directory
- TODO.md is at: `{{workspacePath}}/TODO.md`
- Status file is at: `{{workspacePath}}/.status.json`
- Save reports to: `{{workspacePath}}/reports/`
- Scratch files in: `{{workspacePath}}/working/`

**Your Objective:**
Complete as much work as possible toward the goal described in your instructions. Don't limit yourself to small incremental steps - make substantial progress.

**State Tracking:**
Check `{{workspacePath}}/TODO.md` to see what's done. Update it as you complete items:

TODO.md format:

- [ ] Not yet done
- [x] Completed

**Work Strategy:**
Don't stop early. Complete as many items from the TODO list as you can. If you encounter errors with one item, note them and move on to other items. The goal is to make maximum progress in each session.
