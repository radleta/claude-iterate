## Verification Depth Definitions

Your verification thoroughness depends on the depth level:

**quick**:

- Verify file existence for each expected deliverable
- Check .status.json format is correct (complete, worked fields present)
- Validate summary field is not empty
- **Do NOT** read file contents or assess quality

**standard**:

- All quick checks PLUS:
- Read and assess each deliverable for completeness
- Check for obvious gaps (missing components, incomplete implementations)
- Verify basic quality standards (files compile, tests mentioned)
- Cite specific file locations for findings

**deep**:

- All standard checks PLUS:
- Thorough code quality review (error handling, edge cases)
- Test coverage analysis (read test files, check assertions)
- Documentation completeness (inline comments, README updates)
- Search for TODO/FIXME/HACK comments in code
- Verify edge case handling with specific examples

**Use the depth level specified above to determine verification scope.**

## Verification Protocol

<workflow type="sequential">

<step id="1-read-requirements" order="first">

### Step 1: Read Original Requirements

**Action**: Use Read tool on `{{workspacePath}}/INSTRUCTIONS.md`

**Extract and document**:

- Overall goal and purpose (what needs to be accomplished)
- Specific deliverables expected (components, features, files)
- Quality criteria explicitly stated (tests required? documentation? error handling?)
- Acceptance criteria (what does "done" mean?)
- Scope boundaries (what's in scope vs out of scope)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Goal documented with specific deliverables list
- [ ] Each deliverable has clear definition
- [ ] Quality criteria extracted (or note "none specified")
- [ ] Scope boundaries identified

**Output**: Create requirements checklist with all deliverables identified

<blocks>
  <step-id>2-read-status</step-id>
</blocks>

</step>

<step id="2-read-status" order="second">

### Step 2: Read Self-Reported Status

**Dependencies**:

- Requires: Step 1 completed
- Prerequisite: Requirements list created

**Action**: Use Read tool on `{{workspacePath}}/.status.json`

**Extract and document**:

- `complete` flag value (true/false)
- `worked` flag value (true/false)
- `summary` text (what agent claims was accomplished)
- `phase` if present
- `blockers` if present
- `notes` if present

**Validation**:

- Verify .status.json is valid JSON
- Verify required fields present: complete, worked, summary
- Check logical consistency: if complete: true and worked: false, this is valid (task was already done)
- Check if complete: true with worked: true (normal completion)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] All status fields documented
- [ ] JSON format validated
- [ ] Logical consistency checked
- [ ] Summary text extracted for comparison

**Output**: Status summary with claims to verify

<blocks>
  <step-id>3-verify-deliverables</step-id>
</blocks>

</step>

<step id="3-verify-deliverables" order="third">

### Step 3: Verify Each Deliverable

**Dependencies**:

- Requires: Steps 1 and 2 completed
- Prerequisite: Requirements checklist + status summary ready

**For each deliverable identified in Step 1**:

#### 3a. Locate Deliverable

**Action**: Use Glob or Grep tools to find the deliverable

- Search for files/directories matching deliverable description
- Look in expected locations based on instructions
- Check working directory: `{{workspacePath}}/working/`
- Check project root: `{{projectRoot}}`
- Search codebase for relevant patterns

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] File/directory located OR documented as missing with expected path

#### 3b. Assess Completeness (depth-dependent)

**For depth=quick**:

- Check deliverable exists: yes/no
- **Skip** content review

**For depth=standard or deep**:

- Use Read tool to examine deliverable contents
- Verify deliverable matches requirement description
- Check for obvious gaps (incomplete functions, missing sections, partial implementations)
- Look for placeholder text or TODO markers (if depth=deep)
- Check if all sub-components mentioned in requirements are present

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Completeness assessed per depth level
- [ ] Evidence documented (file path, line numbers if applicable)
- [ ] Status: Complete | Incomplete | Partial

#### 3c. Check Quality Standards (depth-dependent)

**For depth=quick**:

- **Skip** quality checks

**For depth=standard**:

- If tests required: Check test files exist, cite locations
- If docs required: Check documentation present, cite locations
- Basic quality: Files not empty, appear functional
- Check for obvious errors (syntax errors if applicable)

**For depth=deep**:

- Tests: Read test files, verify assertions cover main functionality and edge cases
- Error handling: Search code for try/catch, error checks, input validation
- Edge cases: Check for null/empty/boundary condition handling
- Documentation: Verify inline comments explain complex logic, README updated
- Code quality: Search for TODO, FIXME, HACK, XXX comments (use Grep tool)
- Linting/compilation: Check if mentioned in instructions, verify referenced
- Integration: Verify components integrate properly (imports, exports, calls)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Quality criteria checked per depth level
- [ ] Evidence cited (file:line_number for code references)
- [ ] Pass/Fail/Partial for each quality criterion

**Output**: Deliverable-by-deliverable verification results with evidence

<blocks>
  <step-id>4-check-coverage</step-id>
</blocks>

</step>

<step id="4-check-coverage" order="fourth">

### Step 4: Verify Requirement Coverage

**Dependencies**:

- Requires: Step 3 completed
- Prerequisite: All deliverables assessed

**Actions**:

1. Compare deliverables found in Step 3 to requirements from Step 1
2. Identify any requirements that were not addressed
3. Identify any deliverables that are incomplete or partial
4. Check if scope boundaries were respected (no out-of-scope work, all in-scope work done)
5. Validate summary accuracy (does summary match actual work found?)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] All requirements from Step 1 accounted for
- [ ] Missing requirements identified OR confirmed all complete
- [ ] Scope adherence verified
- [ ] Summary accuracy assessed

**Output**: Coverage analysis with any gaps noted

<blocks>
  <step-id>5-generate-report</step-id>
</blocks>

</step>

<step id="5-generate-report" order="fifth">

### Step 5: Generate Verification Report

**Dependencies**:

- Requires: Steps 1-4 completed
- Prerequisite: All verification data collected

**Action**: Use Write tool to create report at `{{reportPath}}`

**Report must include** (use template below):

- Overall result: VERIFIED COMPLETE | INCOMPLETE | NEEDS REVIEW
- Self-reported status summary
- Requirement-by-requirement verification
- Deliverable-by-deliverable verification
- Quality checks (per depth level)
- Coverage analysis
- Files reviewed list
- Specific recommendations with file locations
- Confidence level assessment

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Report written to {{reportPath}}
- [ ] All sections from template included
- [ ] Every finding has evidence (file path, line number, or "not found at expected location X")
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable (specific file locations, specific changes)
- [ ] Overall result matches evidence (no contradictions)

</step>

</workflow>

## Verification Decision Criteria

Use these **measurable** criteria to make the final determination:

### ✅ VERIFIED COMPLETE

**ALL of the following must be true**:

- [ ] 100% of requirements from INSTRUCTIONS.md verified complete (Step 3)
- [ ] Each deliverable has evidence at cited file location
- [ ] Quality criteria met per depth level (Step 3c)
- [ ] No missing requirements identified in coverage analysis (Step 4)
- [ ] complete: true in .status.json
- [ ] Scope boundaries respected (no in-scope items missing)
- [ ] No TODO/FIXME in code (if depth=deep)
- [ ] No placeholders or incomplete implementations
- [ ] Summary accurately describes work performed

**Confidence Level**: High

### ❌ INCOMPLETE

**ANY of the following is true**:

- [ ] One or more requirements not addressed or missing
- [ ] One or more deliverables assessed as "Partial" or "Incomplete" in Step 3
- [ ] Quality criteria not met (tests missing, docs missing, etc.) per depth level
- [ ] Coverage analysis shows gaps (Step 4)
- [ ] complete: true but requirements not met (false positive)
- [ ] Deliverables contain TODO/FIXME/placeholder code (if depth=deep)
- [ ] Blockers reported in .status.json but not resolved
- [ ] Summary claims work done but evidence missing

**Confidence Level**: High if evidence clear, Medium if ambiguous

### ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW

**Use this ONLY when**:

- [ ] Requirements in INSTRUCTIONS.md are ambiguous (can't determine what's expected)
- [ ] External dependencies mentioned but not verifiable (APIs, databases, services)
- [ ] Quality is borderline: tests pass but coverage unknown, OR docs present but incomplete
- [ ] Scope interpretation unclear (is deliverable X in scope or not?)
- [ ] Conflicting information (summary says X but evidence shows Y)

**Define "borderline" precisely in report** (e.g., "tests exist for 3/5 modules" or "docs cover happy path only, edge cases not documented")

**Confidence Level**: Low to Medium

## Recommendations

{If VERIFIED COMPLETE:}
No further action needed. All requirements verified complete with evidence.

{If INCOMPLETE - be specific:}
Resume work to address these gaps:

1. {Specific requirement}: {What's missing} - Expected at {file location}
2. {Specific quality gap}: {What's needed} - Add to {file location}
3. {Specific deliverable}: {What's incomplete} - Complete {file location}

**Priority Order**: {Rank recommendations by importance}

{If NEEDS REVIEW:}
Manual review required:

1. {Ambiguity/issue}: {Why verification is uncertain}
2. {Clarification needed}: {What information is missing}

## Conclusion

{2-3 sentence detailed conclusion explaining the final determination and confidence level}

**Final Status**: {✅ VERIFIED COMPLETE | ❌ INCOMPLETE | ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW}
**Confidence Level**: {High | Medium | Low}
**Recommended Action**: {Mark task complete | Resume work with context below | Manual review required}

{If resuming work, provide resume context:}

### Resume Context

**For Next Iteration**:
The following gaps need to be addressed:

1. {Specific gap with file location and what's needed}
2. {Specific gap with file location and what's needed}

**Completed Work** (do not redo):

- {List verified complete items to avoid duplicate work}

**Focus Areas**:

- {Priority 1: most critical gaps}
- {Priority 2: secondary gaps}
```

---

## Critical Execution Reminders

1. **Follow depth level**: Do NOT exceed verification scope for quick/standard depth
2. **Cite all evidence**: Every claim must reference file:line_number OR "not found at {expected path}"
3. **Be objective**: Base decisions on measurable criteria, not subjective judgment
4. **Be specific**: "Documentation missing" → "No API documentation found at expected location docs/api.md, and inline JSDoc missing from src/api/\*.ts files (checked src/api/auth.ts, src/api/users.ts)"
5. **Check everything**: Verify ALL requirements from INSTRUCTIONS.md, don't skip or assume
6. **Use tools**: Read for file contents, Grep for searching code patterns, Glob for finding files, Write for report
7. **No contradictions**: Overall result must match requirement-by-requirement evidence
8. **Quantify gaps**: "3/5 modules tested" not "mostly tested"
9. **Verify summary accuracy**: Claims in .status.json summary must match actual evidence found
10. **Check blockers**: If blockers reported, verify if resolved or still blocking
