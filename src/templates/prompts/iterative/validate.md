Validate the instructions for workspace: {{workspaceName}}

**Instructions File**: {{workspacePath}}/INSTRUCTIONS.md
**Report Output**: {{reportPath}}

---

## Task

Review the INSTRUCTIONS.md file against the validation criteria below and generate a comprehensive validation report.

{{validationCriteria}}

---

## Validation Process

1. **Read Instructions**: Use Read tool on {{workspacePath}}/INSTRUCTIONS.md
2. **Evaluate Each Criterion**: Check all 10 criteria (7 REQUIRED, 3 RECOMMENDED) with evidence
3. **Identify Issues**: Note specific problems with examples from the instructions
4. **Assess Readiness**: Determine overall status (Ready / Needs Revision / Major Issues)
5. **Generate Report**: Use Write tool to create report at {{reportPath}}

---

## Report Structure

Create a validation report at: {{reportPath}}

```markdown
# Instruction Validation Report

**Workspace**: {{workspaceName}}
**Mode**: Iterative
**Validation Date**: {ISO 8601 timestamp}

## Overall Assessment

{✅ Ready to execute | ⚠️ Needs revision | ❌ Major issues}

**Summary**: {1-2 sentence overview}

## Criteria Evaluation

{For each of the 10 criteria:}

### {N}. {Criterion Name} ({REQUIRED|RECOMMENDED})

**Status**: ✅ Pass | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Fail

**Evidence**:
{Quote specific text from INSTRUCTIONS.md OR note "Not found"}

**Assessment**:
{How it meets or fails the criterion}

{If issues:}
**Issues**:

- {Specific problem with example}

## Strengths

{What's working well in these instructions}

1. {Strength with evidence}
2. {Strength with evidence}

## Issues Found

{If any issues:}

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

1. {Issue}: {What's wrong} - {Where in instructions}
   **Recommendation**: {How to fix}

### Recommended Improvements

1. {Issue}: {What could be better} - {Where in instructions}
   **Recommendation**: {How to improve}

{If no issues:}
No critical issues found. Instructions meet all required criteria.

## Recommendations

{Specific, actionable steps to improve instructions}

1. {Recommendation with example}
2. {Recommendation with example}

{If ready to execute:}
Instructions are ready for autonomous execution.

## Results Summary

**REQUIRED criteria**: {N/7} passing
**RECOMMENDED criteria**: {N/3} passing
**Overall Status**: {✅ Ready | ⚠️ Needs revision | ❌ Major issues}

## Conclusion

{2-3 sentence assessment of instruction quality and readiness}
```

## Critical Reminders

1. **Be objective**: Base evaluation on measurable criteria from validation-criteria.md
2. **Cite evidence**: Quote specific text or note "Not found" for each criterion
3. **Be constructive**: Provide actionable recommendations, not just criticism
4. **Be thorough**: Check ALL criteria (10 total: 7 REQUIRED + 3 RECOMMENDED)
5. **Be specific**: "Goal unclear" → "Goal states 'migrate auth' but doesn't specify target system or components involved"
