## Verification Depth Definitions

Your verification thoroughness depends on the depth level:

**quick**:

- Verify file existence for each expected deliverable
- Check progress.completed count matches actual completed items
- Validate .status.json format is correct
- **Do NOT** read file contents or assess quality

**standard**:

- All quick checks PLUS:
- Read and assess each deliverable for completeness
- Check for obvious gaps (missing functions, incomplete implementations)
- Verify basic quality standards (files compile, tests mentioned)
- Cite specific file locations for findings

**deep**:

- All standard checks PLUS:
- Thorough code quality review (error handling, edge cases)
- Test coverage analysis (read test files, check assertions)
- Documentation completeness (inline comments, README updates)
- Search for TODO/FIXME/HACK comments in code
- Verify edge case handling with specific examples

**Use the depth level specified above to determine verification scope.**

## Verification Protocol

<workflow type="sequential">

<step id="1-read-requirements" order="first">

### Step 1: Read Original Requirements

**Action**: Use Read tool on `{{workspacePath}}/INSTRUCTIONS.md`

**Extract and document**:

- Total number of items to complete (look for numbered lists, task counts, deliverable lists)
- Specific requirements for each item (what must be delivered)
- Quality criteria explicitly stated (tests required? documentation? error handling?)
- Acceptance criteria (what does "done" mean for each item?)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Requirements list created with all items numbered
- [ ] Each requirement has clear deliverable definition
- [ ] Quality criteria extracted (or note "none specified")
- [ ] Total expected item count documented

**Output**: Create requirements checklist with N items identified

<blocks>
  <step-id>2-read-status</step-id>
</blocks>

</step>

<step id="2-read-status" order="second">

### Step 2: Read Self-Reported Status

**Dependencies**:

- Requires: Step 1 completed
- Prerequisite: Requirements list created

**Action**: Use Read tool on `{{workspacePath}}/.status.json`

**Extract and document**:

- `complete` flag value (true/false)
- `progress.completed` value (number)
- `progress.total` value (number)
- `summary` text (what agent claims was done)
- `phase` if present
- `blockers` if present

**Validation**:

- Verify .status.json is valid JSON
- Verify required fields present: complete, progress.completed, progress.total
- Check if progress.completed === progress.total when complete: true

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] All status fields documented
- [ ] JSON format validated
- [ ] Self-reported count (progress.total) compared to requirements count from Step 1

**Output**: Status summary with claims to verify

<blocks>
  <step-id>3-verify-items</step-id>
</blocks>

</step>

<step id="3-verify-items" order="third">

### Step 3: Verify Each Item

**Dependencies**:

- Requires: Steps 1 and 2 completed
- Prerequisite: Requirements checklist + status summary ready

**For each of the progress.total items identified in Step 1**:

#### 3a. Locate Deliverable

**Action**: Use Glob or Grep tools to find the deliverable

- Search for files matching item description
- Look in expected locations based on instructions
- Check working directory: `{{workspacePath}}/working/`
- Check project root: `{{projectRoot}}`

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] File/directory located OR documented as missing with expected path

#### 3b. Assess Completeness (depth-dependent)

**For depth=quick**:

- Check file exists: yes/no
- **Skip** content review

**For depth=standard or deep**:

- Use Read tool to examine file contents
- Verify deliverable matches requirement description
- Check for obvious gaps (incomplete functions, missing sections)
- Look for placeholder text or TODO markers (if depth=deep)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Completeness assessed per depth level
- [ ] Evidence documented (file path, line numbers if applicable)
- [ ] Status: Complete | Incomplete | Partial

#### 3c. Check Quality Standards (depth-dependent)

**For depth=quick**:

- **Skip** quality checks

**For depth=standard**:

- If tests required: Check test file exists, cite location
- If docs required: Check documentation present, cite location
- Basic quality: File is not empty, appears functional

**For depth=deep**:

- Tests: Read test file, verify assertions cover main functionality
- Error handling: Search code for try/catch, error checks, validation
- Edge cases: Check for null/empty/boundary condition handling
- Documentation: Verify inline comments explain complex logic
- Code quality: Search for TODO, FIXME, HACK, XXX comments (use Grep tool)
- Linting/compilation: Check if mentioned in instructions, verify referenced

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Quality criteria checked per depth level
- [ ] Evidence cited (file:line_number for code references)
- [ ] Pass/Fail/Partial for each quality criterion

**Output**: Item-by-item verification results with evidence

<blocks>
  <step-id>4-check-counts</step-id>
</blocks>

</step>

<step id="4-check-counts" order="fourth">

### Step 4: Verify Count Accuracy

**Dependencies**:

- Requires: Step 3 completed
- Prerequisite: All items assessed

**Actions**:

1. Count items actually complete from Step 3 assessment
2. Compare to self-reported `progress.completed` value
3. Compare to self-reported `progress.total` value
4. Check if any items were skipped or forgotten (compare to requirements from Step 1)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Actual completed count calculated
- [ ] Count matches self-reported OR discrepancy documented
- [ ] All items from Step 1 accounted for OR gaps identified

**Output**: Count verification with any discrepancies noted

<blocks>
  <step-id>5-generate-report</step-id>
</blocks>

</step>

<step id="5-generate-report" order="fifth">

### Step 5: Generate Verification Report

**Dependencies**:

- Requires: Steps 1-4 completed
- Prerequisite: All verification data collected

**Action**: Use Write tool to create report at `{{reportPath}}`

**Report must include** (use template below):

- Overall result: VERIFIED COMPLETE | INCOMPLETE | NEEDS REVIEW
- Self-reported status summary
- Item-by-item verification (all progress.total items)
- Quality checks (per depth level)
- Count verification
- Files reviewed list
- Specific recommendations with file locations
- Confidence level assessment

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Report written to {{reportPath}}
- [ ] All sections from template included
- [ ] Every finding has evidence (file path, line number, or "not found at expected location X")
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable (specific file locations, specific changes)
- [ ] Overall result matches evidence (no contradictions)

</step>

</workflow>

## Verification Decision Criteria

Use these **measurable** criteria to make the final determination:

### ✅ VERIFIED COMPLETE

**ALL of the following must be true**:

- [ ] 100% of progress.total items verified complete (Step 3)
- [ ] Each item has evidence at cited file location
- [ ] Quality criteria met per depth level (Step 3c)
- [ ] progress.completed count is accurate (Step 4)
- [ ] progress.completed === progress.total
- [ ] complete: true in .status.json
- [ ] No gaps identified in Step 1 vs Step 3 comparison
- [ ] No TODO/FIXME in code (if depth=deep)
- [ ] No placeholders or incomplete implementations

**Confidence Level**: High

### ❌ INCOMPLETE

**ANY of the following is true**:

- [ ] One or more items missing or not found at expected location
- [ ] One or more items assessed as "Partial" or "Incomplete" in Step 3
- [ ] Quality criteria not met (tests missing, docs missing, etc.) per depth level
- [ ] progress.completed count inaccurate (doesn't match actual)
- [ ] progress.total doesn't match requirements count from Step 1 (items forgotten)
- [ ] complete: true but items still incomplete (false positive)
- [ ] Deliverables contain TODO/FIXME/placeholder code (if depth=deep)

**Confidence Level**: High if evidence clear, Medium if ambiguous

### ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW

**Use this ONLY when**:

- [ ] Requirements in INSTRUCTIONS.md are ambiguous (can't determine what's expected)
- [ ] External dependencies mentioned but not verifiable (APIs, databases)
- [ ] Quality is borderline: tests pass but coverage unknown, OR docs present but incomplete
- [ ] Scope interpretation unclear (is X in scope or not?)

**Define "borderline" precisely in report** (e.g., "tests exist for 3/5 functions" or "docs cover happy path only, edge cases not documented")

**Confidence Level**: Low to Medium

## Output Template

Write to `{{reportPath}}` using this structure:

```markdown
# Verification Report

**Workspace**: {{workspaceName}}
**Mode**: Loop
**Verification Depth**: {{depth}}
**Verification Date**: {ISO 8601 timestamp}
**Self-Reported Status**: complete: {true/false}, progress: {completed}/{total}

## Overall Result

{✅ VERIFIED COMPLETE | ❌ INCOMPLETE | ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW}

**Confidence Level**: {High | Medium | Low}

## Summary

{1-2 sentence summary: "Verified X/Y items complete. {All quality criteria met | Gaps found in Z}"}

## Requirements Analysis (Step 1)

**Total Items Expected**: {N items from INSTRUCTIONS.md}

**Requirements List**:

1. {Requirement description from INSTRUCTIONS.md}
2. {Requirement description}
   ...

**Quality Criteria Specified**: {List from INSTRUCTIONS.md OR "None specified"}

## Self-Reported Status (Step 2)

**From .status.json**:

- complete: {true/false}
- progress.completed: {N}
- progress.total: {N}
- summary: "{summary text}"
- phase: {phase if present}
- blockers: {blockers if present}

**Validation**: {JSON valid: yes/no, required fields present: yes/no}

## Item-by-Item Verification (Step 3)

{For each of progress.total items:}

### Item {N}: {Brief description from requirements}

- **Expected**: {What was required from INSTRUCTIONS.md}
- **Location Searched**: {Paths checked}
- **Found**: {Yes at /path/to/file:line_number | No - not found at expected location /path}
- **Completeness**: ✅ Complete | ❌ Incomplete | ⚠️ Partial
- **Evidence**: {For complete: cite file:line. For incomplete: "Function X missing, expected at src/file.ts". For partial: "Implemented Y but missing Z at file:line"}
- **Quality Checks** (depth={{depth}}):
  - Tests: {✅ Present at /path/test.ts:lines | ❌ Missing - expected at /path | ➖ Not required at this depth}
  - Docs: {✅ Present at /path:lines | ❌ Missing | ➖ Not required}
  - Error Handling: {✅ Present at file:lines X,Y,Z | ❌ Not found | ➖ Not checked at this depth}
  - Edge Cases: {✅ Handles null/empty/boundary | ❌ Missing | ➖ Not checked}

Resume work to address these gaps:

1. {Specific item/requirement}: {What's missing} - Expected at {file location}
2. {Specific quality gap}: {What's needed} - Add to {file location}

{If NEEDS REVIEW:}
Manual review required:

1. {Ambiguity/issue}: {Why verification is uncertain}

## Conclusion

{2-3 sentence detailed conclusion explaining the final determination and confidence level}

**Final Status**: {✅ VERIFIED COMPLETE | ❌ INCOMPLETE | ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW}
**Confidence Level**: {High | Medium | Low}
**Recommended Action**: {Mark task complete | Resume work | Require manual review}
```

## Critical Execution Reminders

1. **Follow depth level**: Do NOT exceed verification scope for quick/standard depth
2. **Cite all evidence**: Every claim must reference file:line_number OR "not found at {expected path}"
3. **Be objective**: Base decisions on measurable criteria, not subjective judgment
4. **Be specific**: "Tests missing" → "No test file at src/**tests**/auth.test.ts for UserAuth module"
5. **Check everything**: Verify ALL progress.total items, don't skip or sample
6. **Use tools**: Read for file contents, Grep for searching code patterns, Glob for finding files, Write for report
7. **No contradictions**: Overall result must match item-by-item evidence
8. **Quantify gaps**: "3/5 functions tested" not "mostly tested"
