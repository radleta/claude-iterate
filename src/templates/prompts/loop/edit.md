Let's refine the instructions for workspace: {{workspaceName}}

Read the current INSTRUCTIONS.md from: {{workspacePath}}/INSTRUCTIONS.md

**Context**: These instructions guide an automated iteration loop where:
1. Each iteration, you read INSTRUCTIONS.md and TODO.md
2. You do work and update TODO.md with progress
3. The loop continues until "Remaining: 0" is found in TODO.md

**Current instructions** are in INSTRUCTIONS.md in the workspace directory.

**Your Role**:
Review the current INSTRUCTIONS.md and have a conversation with me about what needs to change. Ask questions to understand my concerns or desired improvements. Don't force a rigid format - let the conversation flow naturally.

When we agree on changes, update the INSTRUCTIONS.md file in the workspace directory.
