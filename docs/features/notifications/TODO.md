## Decisions Made

### Decision: Use native fetch instead of external HTTP library

**Date:** 2024-Q4
**Context:** Need to send HTTP POST notifications to ntfy.sh-compatible endpoints
**Decision:** Use Node.js native `fetch` API (available in Node 18+)
**Rationale:**

- No external dependencies needed (axios, node-fetch, etc.)
- Project already requires Node 18+ (fetch available)
- Simpler testing (mock `global.fetch`)
- Smaller bundle size
  **Alternatives Considered:**
- axios - More features but adds dependency
- node-fetch - Requires separate package in Node 18+
- http/https modules - More verbose, callback-based

### Decision: Use fs.watch instead of chokidar for file watching

**Date:** 2024-Q4
**Context:** Need to watch `.status.json` file for changes during task execution
**Decision:** Use Node.js native `fs.watch` API
**Rationale:**

- No external dependencies needed
- Sufficient for single-file watching use case
- Debouncing handles platform-specific quirks
- Lightweight and fast
  **Alternatives Considered:**
- chokidar - More robust but adds 50+ KB dependency
- fs.watchFile - Polling-based, higher CPU usage
- Manual polling - Inefficient, higher latency

### Decision: Default debounce to 2 seconds

**Date:** 2024-Q4
**Context:** File watcher needs to prevent notification spam during rapid updates
**Decision:** Use 2000ms (2 seconds) default debounce delay
**Rationale:**

- Balances responsiveness with spam prevention
- Claude typically updates status every 5-10 seconds (2s is safe)
- Configurable for users who want faster/slower notifications
- Tested in practice, works well
  **Alternatives Considered:**
- 1 second - Too aggressive, may send duplicate notifications
- 5 seconds - Too slow, users want more frequent updates
- 500ms - Too fast, platform differences could cause issues

### Decision: Filter timestamp-only changes by default

**Date:** 2024-Q4
**Context:** `.status.json` updates `lastUpdated` field on every write, even if no progress made
**Decision:** Enable `notifyOnlyMeaningful: true` by default in StatusFileWatcher
**Rationale:**

- Prevents notification spam from timestamp-only updates
- Users care about actual progress changes, not timestamps
- Configurable for users who want all updates
- Reduces notification noise significantly
  **Alternatives Considered:**
- Notify on all changes - Spams users with meaningless updates
- Remove lastUpdated field - Breaks backward compatibility
- Client-side filtering - Pushes complexity to notification endpoints

## Implementation Notes

### Useful References

- [ntfy.sh API Documentation](https://ntfy.sh/docs/publish/)
- [Node.js fetch API](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/globals.html#fetch)
- [Node.js fs.watch API](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fswatchfilename-options-listener)
- [EventEmitter Pattern](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#class-eventemitter)

### Testing Notes

- Test framework: Vitest
- Mock `global.fetch` in all tests (no real HTTP requests)
- Use real file system for file watcher tests (temporary directories)
- Coverage verified: ≥80% for both services

### Integration Points

- CLI flags: `--notify-url`, `--notify-events` in `init` command
- Commands: `setup`, `run` send notifications
- Config: `notifyUrl`, `notifyEvents`, `notification.statusWatch` settings
- Metadata: `notifyUrl`, `notifyEvents` stored in `.metadata.json`
