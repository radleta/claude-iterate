## Blockers

**Current Blockers:** 0

No active blockers. Feature is complete and documented.

## Decisions Made

### Decision: Use child process spawn, not API calls

**Date:** Original implementation (before brownfield documentation)
**Context:** Need to execute Claude CLI from Node.js application
**Decision:** Use Node.js `child_process.spawn()` with piped stdout/stderr
**Rationale:**

- Reuses existing Claude CLI installation (no need to bundle or manage)
- Avoids API key management complexity
- Leverages Claude CLI's project awareness features
- Allows process management (graceful shutdown, zombie detection)
  **Alternatives Considered:**
- Direct API calls - Requires API key, loses project context, more complex
- Shell execution - Security risk (command injection), less control over process lifecycle

### Decision: Separate execution methods for tool visibility

**Date:** Original implementation (before brownfield documentation)
**Context:** Need to show tool usage in verbose mode without overhead in progress/quiet modes
**Decision:** Create two execution methods: `executeNonInteractive()` and `executeWithToolVisibility()`
**Rationale:**

- Avoids ~10KB `ndjson` dependency overhead when not needed
- Prevents stream parsing overhead in progress/quiet modes
- Keeps verbose mode implementation isolated
  **Alternatives Considered:**
- Always use stream-json - Adds overhead even when not needed
- Parse output manually - Complex, error-prone, duplicates Claude CLI functionality

### Decision: Log static content once at start

**Date:** Original implementation (before brownfield documentation)
**Context:** Log files contained redundant content repeated for every iteration
**Decision:** Log instructions, system prompt, status instructions once at run start
**Rationale:**

- Reduces log file size by ~60% (verified with real workspaces)
- Improves readability (focus on iteration-specific changes)
- Maintains full auditability (all content still logged)
  **Alternatives Considered:**
- Log per iteration - Creates redundant 50KB+ per iteration
- Don't log at all - Loses auditability and debugging capability

### Decision: Use .status.json for completion detection

**Date:** Original implementation (before brownfield documentation)
**Context:** TODO.md parsing prone to false positives from completion markers in instructions/examples
**Decision:** Primary completion detection via machine-readable `.status.json` file
**Rationale:**

- Prevents false positives (machine-readable, unambiguous)
- Supports both loop mode (progress counts) and iterative mode (worked flag)
- Easy for Claude to update via Write tool
- Graceful fallback to TODO.md for legacy workspaces
  **Alternatives Considered:**
- Parse TODO.md only - Prone to ambiguity, false positives
- Natural language understanding - Complex, unreliable, slow

### Decision: Stagnation detection only in iterative mode

**Date:** Original implementation (before brownfield documentation)
**Context:** Need to detect when Claude stops making progress in iterative mode
**Decision:** Enable stagnation detection only for iterative mode (not loop mode)
**Rationale:**

- Loop mode has explicit step tracking (one item per iteration)
- Iterative mode is autonomous (multiple items per iteration, needs safety net)
- Default threshold: 2 consecutive no-work iterations (balances safety vs. trust)
- Threshold 0 disables detection (trust Claude completely)
  **Alternatives Considered:**
- Enable for both modes - Unnecessary complexity for loop mode
- No stagnation detection - Risk of infinite loops in iterative mode

### Testing Notes

- All tests use mock Claude client (no real API calls)
- Fast test execution (<5 seconds for 228 tests)
- Deterministic results (no flaky tests)
- CI-friendly (runs on GitHub Actions)

### Known Implementation Details

**Zombie Process Detection:**

- 5-minute timeout implemented in `ClaudeClient.executeNonInteractive()`
- Checks `child.exitCode !== null || child.killed` before timing out
- If zombie: Resolves with stdout (likely success)
- If still running: Rejects with timeout error

**Log File Deduplication:**

- Static content logged once: instructions, system prompt, status instructions
- Dynamic content logged per iteration: Claude output, status, errors
- ~60% size reduction verified with real workspaces

**Tool Visibility Overhead:**

- ~10KB `ndjson` package dependency
- Only loaded in verbose mode
- Parse errors handled gracefully (`strict: false`)
