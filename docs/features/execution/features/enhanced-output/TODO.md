## Current Status

**Phase**: Planning complete for both sub-features

**Summary**: Parent feature documentation streamlined. Both sub-features have complete SDD documentation and are ready for implementation.

**Implementation Order**: statistics-display (first) â†’ graceful-stop (second, depends on first)

## Sub-Feature Progress

- [ ] [Statistics Display TODO](./features/statistics-display/TODO.md) - 0/8 tasks (ready to start)
- [ ] [Graceful Stop TODO](./features/graceful-stop/TODO.md) - 0/8 tasks (blocked by statistics-display)

## Parent-Level Tasks

- [ ] End-to-end integration test (verify sub-features work together)
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Performance validation (combined benchmarks)

## Blockers

**Current blockers**: None (planning phase)

**Potential blockers**:

- If chalk version incompatibility found during implementation
- If platform-specific issues arise during testing

**Resolution plan**: Address blockers as they arise during implementation

## Decisions Log

### Decision 1: Sub-Feature Organization (Resolved)

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Decision**: Split into 2 user-facing sub-features (statistics-display + graceful-stop)
**Rationale**: Cleaner separation of concerns, independent implementation
**Impact**: Can implement statistics-display first, graceful-stop depends on it

### Decision 2: Parent Documentation Approach (Resolved)

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Decision**: Parent feature has minimal documentation, sub-features have details
**Rationale**: Avoid duplication, maintain single source of truth
**Impact**: Parent README/SPEC/TEST/TODO are high-level, link to sub-features
