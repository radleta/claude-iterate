## summary: Beautiful terminal UI with real-time statistics and graceful stop controls for run command

## Purpose

Provide beautiful, informative terminal UI for the `run` command with two distinct user capabilities: (1) real-time execution statistics display and (2) graceful stop controls, replacing simple progress output with an interactive experience.

## Sub-Features

1. **[Statistics Display](./features/statistics-display/README.md)** - Beautiful terminal UI with real-time execution statistics (Status: Planning)
2. **[Graceful Stop](./features/graceful-stop/README.md)** - User-controlled graceful stop via keyboard or file (Status: Planning, depends on statistics-display)

## Integration

This parent feature integrates two sub-features:

1. **Statistics Display** provides the UI foundation (IterationStats interface, ConsoleReporter enhancements)
2. **Graceful Stop** adds stop controls (uses IterationStats.stopRequested field, ConsoleReporter renders stop indicator)

**Dependency**: graceful-stop depends on statistics-display (needs IterationStats interface)

See sub-features for user stories, acceptance criteria, and implementation details.
