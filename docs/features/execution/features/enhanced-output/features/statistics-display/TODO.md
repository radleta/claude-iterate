## Current Status

**Phase**: Refactoring complete - Production ready

## Blockers

**Current blockers**: None

**Potential blockers**:

- If chalk version incompatibility found during implementation
- If Unicode characters don't render on target terminals
- If ANSI escape codes don't work in specific environments

**Resolution plan**: Test on actual platforms early, implement fallbacks

## Decisions Log

### Decision 1: Sub-Feature Independence (Resolved)

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Decision**: Statistics-display is independent of graceful-stop
**Rationale**: Statistics display works without stop functionality, can be implemented first
**Impact**: Can start implementation immediately without waiting for graceful-stop

### Decision 2: Footer Placeholder (Resolved)

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Decision**: Reserve footer area for graceful-stop sub-feature keyboard controls
**Rationale**: Statistics-display UI includes box bottom, graceful-stop will add keyboard controls there
**Impact**: UI has placeholder text in footer initially, will be replaced when graceful-stop is implemented

### Decision 3: Stop Signal Fields in IterationStats (Resolved)

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Decision**: Include `stopRequested` and `stopSource` fields in IterationStats interface
**Rationale**: Statistics display needs to show stop indicator when graceful-stop requests stop
**Impact**: Fields present but always false/null until graceful-stop is implemented

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Can we implement statistics-display without graceful-stop?

**A**: Yes. Statistics-display is independent and can be implemented first. The `stopRequested` and `stopSource` fields will simply always be false/null until graceful-stop is implemented.

### Q: What happens to the footer area before graceful-stop is implemented?

**A**: It shows placeholder text: "[Stop controls reserved for graceful-stop sub-feature]". This will be replaced with keyboard controls when graceful-stop is implemented.

### Q: How do we test TTY detection without a real terminal?

**A**: Mock `process.stdout.isTTY` in tests. Use synthetic output capture instead of actual terminal rendering.

### Q: What if Unicode characters don't work on Windows?

**A**: The code includes automatic detection and ASCII fallback for legacy Windows console. Test on both Windows Terminal (Unicode) and legacy console (ASCII).

## Notes

### Investigation Findings

- **Existing dependencies**: chalk ^5.4.1 (ESM-only), Node.js ≥18
- **Code patterns**: PascalCase classes, camelCase functions, 2-space indent
- **Test patterns**: Vitest, mocked tests, tests/unit/ and tests/integration/
- **Similar features**: ConsoleReporter (existing), ClaudeClient, StatusFileWatcher
- **Integration point**: src/commands/run.ts (~650 lines)

### Implementation Tips

- **Start with types**: Create iteration-stats.ts first (foundation for everything)
- **Mock TTY early**: Set up test mocks for process.stdout.isTTY before implementation
- **Test on real terminals**: Don't rely solely on mocks for UI validation
- **Snapshot tests**: Use for UI rendering (easy to update if design changes)
- **Cross-platform CI**: Run tests on all platforms in GitHub Actions

### Performance Considerations

- **Debounce UI updates**: Max 2 Hz (500ms minimum) to prevent flicker
- **Limit memory**: Track only last 10 iteration durations (O(1) space)
- **Minimize calculations**: ETA formula is simple O(1) operation
- **String operations**: Use array + join() instead of repeated concatenation

### Security Considerations

- **ANSI injection**: Sanitize workspace names and task summaries before display
- **Terminal state**: Cleanup ensures terminal is restored even if process crashes
- **No user input**: This feature only displays information, doesn't accept input

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Before Implementation)

1. **User review**: Wait for user to review and approve parent feature specifications
2. **Answer questions**: Address any user questions about approach
3. **Revise if needed**: Update specs based on user feedback

### Phase 1 (After Approval)

1. **Create iteration-stats.ts**: Types and helper functions
2. **Create box-characters.ts**: Platform-aware box character selection
3. **Run typecheck**: Verify types compile correctly

### Phase 2 (After Phase 1)

1. **Enhance console-reporter.ts**: Add TTY detection and rendering methods
2. **Test rendering**: Verify UI displays correctly (manual test)
3. **Run existing tests**: Ensure no breaking changes

### Phase 3 (After Phase 2)

1. **Integrate with run.ts**: Initialize stats tracker and enhanced reporter
2. **Manual testing**: Run `claude-iterate run` and verify UI works
3. **Test in non-TTY**: Verify simple output in Docker/CI

### Phase 4 (After Phase 3)

1. **Write unit tests**: Achieve ≥80% coverage
2. **Write integration test**: Verify end-to-end flow
3. **Run all tests**: Ensure everything passes

## Future Enhancements (Not in Initial Spec)

- More statistics (success/failure rate, memory usage)
- Export stats to JSON file
- Custom themes and color schemes
- Real-time graphing or charts
- Notification integration with stats updates
