# Implementation Plan: Enhanced Run Output

## Overview

This feature is implemented as **two sub-features** using Roadmap mode. Each sub-feature has its own detailed PLAN.md with specific tasks.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Statistics Display

**[Statistics Display](./features/statistics-display/README.md)** | [PLAN.md](./features/statistics-display/PLAN.md)

- **Status:** Not started
- **Dependencies:** None (can start immediately)
- **Tasks:** 8 implementation tasks (see sub-feature PLAN.md)
- **Duration:** ~2-3 hours

**Key deliverables:**

- IterationStats interface and helper functions
- Enhanced ConsoleReporter with UI rendering
- Integration with run.ts
- Unit and integration tests

---

### Phase 2: Graceful Stop

**[Graceful Stop](./features/graceful-stop/README.md)** | [PLAN.md](./features/graceful-stop/PLAN.md)

- **Status:** Not started
- **Dependencies:** Requires Statistics Display complete
- **Tasks:** 8 tasks (see sub-feature PLAN.md)
- **Duration:** ~2-3 hours

**Key deliverables:**

- StopSignal class with keyboard and file detection
- Stop command CLI
- Integration with run.ts
- Unit and integration tests

---

### Phase 3: Integration Testing

**Parent-level integration** (not part of sub-features)

- **Status:** Not started
- **Dependencies:** Both sub-features complete
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] End-to-end integration test (verify sub-features work together)
  - [ ] Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - [ ] Performance validation (<10ms render, <1MB memory)
  - [ ] Update parent feature TODO.md with final status

**Test file:** `tests/integration/enhanced-output-integration.test.ts`

## Implementation Order

1. **First:** Implement statistics-display (no blockers)
2. **Second:** Implement graceful-stop (after statistics-display complete)
3. **Third:** Integration testing (after both complete)

## Validation Checkpoints

- [ ] [Statistics Display complete](./features/statistics-display/TODO.md) - All 8 tasks validated
- [ ] [Graceful Stop complete](./features/graceful-stop/TODO.md) - All 6 tasks validated
- [ ] Integration test passes
- [ ] Cross-platform tests pass
- [ ] Performance validated
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Total Scope

- **Total tasks:** 17 (8 statistics-display + 8 graceful-stop + 1 parent integration)
- **Estimated duration:** 4-6 hours
- **Test coverage target:** â‰¥80% across all new code

## Notes

- See sub-feature PLAN.md files for detailed task breakdowns
- Integration test is the only parent-level implementation work
- All other implementation happens within sub-features
