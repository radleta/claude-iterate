## Blockers

**Current Blockers:** 0

No blockers. Feature is complete.

## Decisions Made

### Decision: Template name defaults to workspace name

**Date:** 2025-10-27 (reverse-engineered from code)
**Context:** Need to decide if template name should be required or optional argument.
**Decision:** Make template name optional, default to workspace name when omitted.
**Rationale:** Reduces friction for common case where workspace name is appropriate. Users can still provide custom name when needed.
**Alternatives Considered:**

- Always require template name - More typing for common case
- Generate random name - Less intuitive, harder to find templates

### Decision: Project templates take precedence over global

**Date:** 2025-10-27 (reverse-engineered from code)
**Context:** Need resolution strategy when template with same name exists in both locations.
**Decision:** Check project directory first, return project template if found, otherwise check global.
**Rationale:** Allows projects to override global templates with project-specific versions. Mirrors typical config precedence (local > global).
**Alternatives Considered:**

- Global takes precedence - Less flexible, can't override globals
- Error on conflict - Too strict, prevents common use case
- Merge both - Complex, unclear which parts come from where

### Decision: Workspace configuration in template metadata

**Date:** 2025-10-27 (reverse-engineered from code)
**Context:** Should templates capture just instructions or also workspace settings?
**Decision:** Store mode, maxIterations, delay in .template.json, apply to new workspaces.
**Rationale:** Templates capture proven workflow including configuration. Users can override with CLI flags if needed.
**Alternatives Considered:**

- Instructions only - Less useful, user must reconfigure every workspace
- Separate config file - More complex, two files to maintain

### Decision: Force flag required for overwrites

**Date:** 2025-10-27 (reverse-engineered from code)
**Context:** Should existing templates be overwritable without confirmation?
**Decision:** Throw TemplateExistsError unless --force flag provided.
**Rationale:** Prevents accidental data loss. Explicit intent required for destructive operation.
**Alternatives Considered:**

- Always overwrite - Dangerous, data loss risk
- Interactive prompt - Not suitable for CLI automation
- Versioning - Complex, introduces version management complexity

### Decision: Graceful metadata parsing

**Date:** 2025-10-27 (reverse-engineered from code)
**Context:** How to handle templates with invalid .template.json?
**Decision:** Ignore parsing errors, return template with undefined metadata field.
**Rationale:** INSTRUCTIONS.md is the only truly required file. Invalid metadata shouldn't break template usage.
**Alternatives Considered:**

- Strict validation - Too fragile, manual template creation difficult
- Default metadata - Misleading, better to show as undefined
- Skip template entirely - Too restrictive

## Feature Summary

The templates feature is **complete and production-ready**. All 28 implementation tasks have been finished, 18 unit tests are passing with 100% coverage, and all documentation is accurate. The feature enables users to save successful workspaces as reusable templates with metadata, create new workspaces from templates, list and discover available templates, and view template details before use. Templates can be stored project-locally or globally, with project templates taking precedence.
