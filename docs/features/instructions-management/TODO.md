## Implementation Progress

**Current Status:** All implementation tasks completed

**Progress:** 23/23 tasks completed (100%)

### Tasks from PLAN.md

#### Phase 1: CLI Command Handlers

- [x] Create src/commands/setup.ts command handler
  - Status: Complete
  - Notes: Interactive Claude session with mode-aware prompts

- [x] Create src/commands/edit.ts command handler
  - Status: Complete
  - Notes: Instructions existence check, interactive session

- [x] Create src/commands/validate.ts command handler
  - Status: Complete
  - Notes: Non-interactive session, report generation

#### Phase 2: Validation Criteria System

- [x] Create src/templates/validation-criteria.ts
  - Status: Complete
  - Notes: 7 REQUIRED + 3 RECOMMENDED criteria

#### Phase 3: Mode-Aware Prompt Templates

- [x] Create src/templates/prompts/loop/setup.md template
  - Status: Complete
  - Notes: Critical principle section added

- [x] Create src/templates/prompts/loop/edit.md template
  - Status: Complete
  - Notes: Review and improvement guidance

- [x] Create src/templates/prompts/loop/validate.md template
  - Status: Complete
  - Notes: 10 criteria evaluation, structured report

#### Phase 4: CLI Integration

- [x] Register setup, edit, validate commands in src/cli.ts
  - Status: Complete
  - Notes: All three commands integrated

## Quality Validation

### Code Quality

- [x] Linter passes with 0 warnings
- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [x] No duplicate code
- [x] All functions have docstrings
- [x] Code follows project conventions

### Testing

- [x] Unit tests exist (brownfield - need to verify coverage)
- [x] Integration tests exist (mocked ClaudeClient pattern established)
- [x] Test coverage target defined (>=80%)
- [x] Security tests defined in TEST.md

**Note:** This is a brownfield feature. Tests may need to be added to meet coverage targets. Current test pattern uses mocked ClaudeClient from tests/mocks/claude-client.mock.ts.

### Documentation

- [x] README.md complete with accurate information
- [x] SPEC.md reflects actual implementation
- [x] CLI commands documented with all options
- [x] Code comments explain "why" not "what"
- [x] CHANGELOG.md does not need update (brownfield documentation)

## Blockers

**Current Blockers:** 0

No blockers. Feature is fully implemented and operational.

## Decisions Made

### Decision: Mode-Aware Prompts via Strategy Pattern

**Date:** 2025-10-28 (documented during brownfield analysis)
**Context:** Need to support different instruction guidance for loop vs iterative modes
**Decision:** Use ModeFactory with strategy pattern to select mode-specific prompt templates
**Rationale:** Avoids conditional logic in commands, makes adding new modes easier, keeps prompts focused
**Alternatives Considered:**

- Conditional logic in commands - More complex, harder to maintain
- Single template with mode parameter - Less flexible, harder to customize per mode

### Decision: Dual Config Loading

**Date:** 2025-10-28 (documented during brownfield analysis)
**Context:** Need to respect workspace-level config overrides (claudeCommand, claudeArgs)
**Decision:** Load config twice: once for workspacesDir, again with metadata for overrides
**Rationale:** Ensures workspace-specific settings applied correctly while still using standard path resolution
**Alternatives Considered:**

- Single config load - Would miss workspace overrides
- Manual override merging - More complex, error-prone

### Decision: Validation as Non-Interactive

**Date:** 2025-10-28 (documented during brownfield analysis)
**Context:** Need consistent, automated validation reports
**Decision:** Run validate command non-interactively to produce report without user input
**Rationale:** Enables automation, consistent output format, can be used in CI/CD
**Alternatives Considered:**

- Interactive validation - Inconsistent results, requires user presence
- Validation during setup - Couples setup and validation too tightly

### Decision: Critical Principle - No System Mechanics in Instructions

**Date:** 2025-10-28 (documented during brownfield analysis)
**Context:** Instructions must be task-focused, not explain how claude-iterate works
**Decision:** Prohibit references to "iterations", "loops", system mechanics in INSTRUCTIONS.md
**Rationale:** Keeps instructions focused on task goals, prevents confusion about system vs task
**Alternatives Considered:**

- Allow system references - Would confuse task goals with system implementation
- Separate system explanation file - Adds complexity, users might mix them up
