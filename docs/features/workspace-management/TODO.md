## Blockers

**Current Blockers:** 0

No blockers. Feature is complete and operational.

## Decisions Made

### Decision: Workspace isolation through directory structure

**Date:** Pre-v1.0.0
**Context:** Need to manage multiple concurrent tasks without conflicts
**Decision:** Create isolated directory per workspace with metadata, instructions, status, and working files
**Rationale:**

- Complete isolation prevents task interference
- Directory-based approach is simple and transparent
- Easy to archive, backup, and restore
- Works with version control (though protected by pre-commit hook)
  **Alternatives Considered:**
- Database storage - Rejected: Too complex for CLI tool, harder to inspect
- Single shared directory - Rejected: Risk of conflicts and hard to track progress

### Decision: Machine-readable status file (.status.json)

**Date:** Pre-v2.0.0
**Context:** Need reliable completion detection without false positives from instruction text
**Decision:** Create separate .status.json with structured completion signals
**Rationale:**

- Prevents false positives from "complete" appearing in instructions or examples
- Structured data is easier to validate and parse
- Supports both loop mode (progress counts) and iterative mode (work flags)
- Machine-readable for automation and tooling
  **Alternatives Considered:**
- Parse TODO.md for completion - Rejected: Brittle, prone to false positives
- Marker in INSTRUCTIONS.md - Rejected: User might accidentally write completion markers

### Decision: Mode-aware completion detection

**Date:** Pre-v2.0.0
**Context:** Loop and iterative modes have fundamentally different semantics
**Decision:** Use metadata.mode to dispatch to correct completion logic (CompletionDetector)
**Rationale:**

- Single Workspace class supports both modes without duplication
- Each mode can evolve independently
- Clear separation of concerns (Workspace delegates to CompletionDetector)
  **Alternatives Considered:**
- Separate LoopWorkspace and IterativeWorkspace classes - Rejected: Code duplication
- Universal completion logic - Rejected: Modes have incompatible semantics

### Decision: Archive before delete by default

**Date:** Pre-v2.0.0
**Context:** Users may accidentally delete workspaces with important work
**Decision:** Clean command archives workspace unless --no-archive flag provided
**Rationale:**

- Safety net against accidental data loss
- Archives compressed and stored in known location
- User can opt out with explicit flag
  **Alternatives Considered:**
- Never archive - Rejected: Too risky
- Require --archive flag - Rejected: Archive should be default behavior

### Decision: No locking mechanism for concurrent access

**Date:** Pre-v1.0.0
**Context:** User might run multiple commands on same workspace simultaneously
**Decision:** Do not implement file locking, document that user should avoid concurrent access
**Rationale:**

- Complexity of cross-platform file locking not justified
- Concurrent access is rare edge case (user error)
- Worst case: Iteration count inaccuracy, no data corruption
  **Alternatives Considered:**
- File locking - Rejected: Complex, platform-specific, not worth the effort
- Database with transactions - Rejected: Overkill for CLI tool

## Implementation Notes

### Code Locations

**Core Classes:**

- `src/core/workspace.ts` - Workspace class (309 lines)
- `src/core/metadata.ts` - MetadataManager class (142 lines)
- `src/types/metadata.ts` - Metadata Zod schema
- `src/types/status.ts` - WorkspaceStatus Zod schema

**CLI Commands:**

- `src/commands/init.ts` - Init command (112 lines)
- `src/commands/list.ts` - List command (117 lines)
- `src/commands/show.ts` - Show command (164 lines)
- `src/commands/clean.ts` - Clean command (78 lines)
- `src/commands/reset.ts` - Reset command (47 lines)

**Tests:**

- `tests/unit/workspace.test.ts` - 27 tests covering Workspace class
- `tests/unit/metadata.test.ts` - 15 tests covering MetadataManager
- `tests/unit/commands/show.test.ts` - Error handling tests
- `tests/unit/commands/config.test.ts` - Config operations (includes workspace config)

### Key Integration Points

**ConfigManager:**

- Used by all commands to load workspace directory path
- Priority: CLI → Project → User → Defaults
- Workspace-specific config stored in .metadata.json

**ArchiveManager:**

- Used by clean command to create tarball archives
- Archive format: `workspace-name-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.tar.gz`
- Stored in configured archive directory

**CompletionDetector:**

- Used by Workspace for mode-aware completion detection
- Reads .status.json and applies mode-specific logic
- Returns completion status with remaining count

**StatusManager:**

- Used by Workspace to read/validate .status.json
- Zod schema validation
- Returns validation warnings for invalid status

### File Structure Pattern

```
claude-iterate/workspaces/my-task/
├── .metadata.json          # MetadataManager writes/reads
├── .status.json            # Run command creates, StatusManager reads
├── INSTRUCTIONS.md         # Setup command creates, Workspace reads
├── TODO.md                 # Init creates placeholder, Run updates
├── iterate-20251028-143000.log  # Run command creates (timestamped)
└── working/                # Scratch space (user/Claude create files here)
```
