## Blockers

## Decisions Made

### Decision: Use Zod for schema validation

**Date:** 2025-10-27 (retroactive documentation)
**Context:** Need runtime validation of config files to prevent invalid configurations
**Decision:** Use Zod for schema definition and validation
**Rationale:**

- Zod provides both TypeScript types and runtime validation from same schema definition
- Built-in defaults support matches config system needs
- Introspection capabilities enable --keys feature
- Already used elsewhere in codebase (consistency)

**Alternatives Considered:**

- JSON Schema with ajv - More verbose, less TypeScript integration
- Manual validation - Error-prone, no type safety
- io-ts - Similar features but Zod has better DX

### Decision: Layered config with explicit priority

**Date:** 2025-10-27 (retroactive documentation)
**Context:** Need config to work across project, user, and workspace scopes
**Decision:** Implement git-style layered config with priority: CLI → Workspace → Project → User → Defaults
**Rationale:**

- Familiar pattern for developers (matches git config behavior)
- Explicit priority rules prevent confusion
- Enables team defaults (project) and personal preferences (user)
- Workspace overrides allow per-task customization

**Alternatives Considered:**

- Single config file - Too inflexible for multi-user/multi-project scenarios
- Environment variables only - Poor discoverability, no persistence

### Decision: Dot notation for nested keys

**Date:** 2025-10-27 (retroactive documentation)
**Context:** Config has nested structure (verification.depth, claude.args), need intuitive CLI syntax
**Decision:** Use dot notation for accessing nested keys
**Rationale:**

- Intuitive for developers (common in many tools)
- Avoids need for JSON literals on CLI
- Enables targeted updates without editing JSON manually
- Familiar pattern from git config, npm config, etc.

**Alternatives Considered:**

- JSON paths ($.verification.depth) - Too complex for simple use case
- Separate commands per level - Too many commands, poor UX
- Require JSON editing - Poor UX, error-prone

### Decision: --keys flag with source tracking

**Date:** 2025-10-27 (retroactive documentation)
**Context:** Users need to discover available config keys and understand where values come from
**Decision:** Implement --keys flag with schema inspection and effective value resolution
**Rationale:**

- Enables self-service discovery (no need to read docs for every key)
- Source tracking shows which config file is controlling each setting
- Helps debug unexpected config values
- Provides both human-readable and JSON output

**Alternatives Considered:**

- Document all keys in README - Gets out of sync, not discoverable from CLI
- No discovery feature - Poor UX, requires docs/code reading

## Implementation Notes

### Useful References

- Zod documentation: https://zod.dev/
- Commander.js patterns: Existing commands in `src/commands/`
- Config patterns: Git config, npm config (inspiration)

### Testing Notes

- 228 tests passing across entire test suite
- Config-specific tests in:
  - `tests/unit/config-manager.test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/commands/config.test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/config-value-flattener.test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/config-keys-formatter.test.ts`
  - `tests/integration/config-inheritance.test.ts`
- All tests use mocked file system or temp directories
- No real config file writes in CI
