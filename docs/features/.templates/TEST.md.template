# Testing Specification: Feature Name

<!--
  This document defines the testing requirements and strategy for this feature.
  It complements SPEC.md by detailing how the feature will be verified.

  Create this file when:
  - Testing requirements are complex and warrant separate documentation
  - Multiple testing strategies are needed (unit, integration, e2e, performance)
  - Testing needs to be coordinated across teams

  For simple features, testing requirements can remain in SPEC.md.

  REMEMBER: This documents an APPLICATION FEATURE - a discrete unit of functionality
  that delivers value to end users or enables core business capabilities. Features are
  what the application *does*, not how it's organized internally. See CONTRIBUTING.md
  "What is a Feature?" section for full definition and examples.
-->

## Test Coverage Targets

<!--
  Define minimum coverage requirements.
  Be specific about what needs to be tested and to what degree.
-->

- **Unit Test Coverage**: 80% minimum for business logic
- **Integration Test Coverage**: All API endpoints and external service integrations
- **End-to-End Test Coverage**: All critical user flows
- **Performance Test Coverage**: Key performance-sensitive operations

## Testing Layers

### Layer 1: Unit Tests

<!--
  Test individual functions, methods, and components in isolation.
  Focus on business logic, validation, and edge cases.
-->

**Scope:**
- All business logic functions
- Validation functions
- Utility functions
- Error handling logic

**Key Test Scenarios:**
1. **[Function/Component Name]**
   - Valid input: [expected behavior]
   - Invalid input: [expected error]
   - Edge case: [specific edge case and expected behavior]

2. **[Another Function/Component]**
   - [Scenario]: [Expected outcome]

**Example Test:**
```typescript
describe('generateResetToken', () => {
  it('should generate a 32-byte token', async () => {
    const token = await generateResetToken('user@example.com');
    expect(token).toHaveLength(64); // 32 bytes = 64 hex chars
  });

  it('should throw error for invalid email', async () => {
    await expect(generateResetToken('invalid')).rejects.toThrow('Invalid email');
  });
});
```

### Layer 2: Integration Tests

<!--
  Test how components work together and with external systems.
  Focus on API endpoints, database interactions, and service integrations.
-->

**Scope:**
- All API endpoints (request/response validation)
- Database operations (CRUD, transactions)
- External service integrations (email, payment, etc.)
- Authentication and authorization flows

**Key Test Scenarios:**
1. **POST /api/v1/feature/action**
   - Success case: Valid request returns 200
   - Validation: Invalid input returns 400
   - Auth: Unauthorized request returns 401
   - Rate limiting: Exceeded limit returns 429

2. **Database Integration**
   - Create: Record is stored correctly
   - Read: Queries return expected results
   - Update: Changes are persisted
   - Delete: Records are removed or soft-deleted

**Example Test:**
```typescript
describe('POST /api/v1/feature/action', () => {
  it('should create a new record', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/v1/feature/action')
      .send({ field: 'value' })
      .expect(200);

    expect(response.body.id).toBeDefined();
    expect(response.body.field).toBe('value');
  });
});
```

### Layer 3: End-to-End Tests

<!--
  Test complete user flows from start to finish.
  Focus on critical paths and user journeys.
-->

**Scope:**
- Critical user workflows
- Multi-step processes
- Cross-feature interactions

**Key User Flows:**
1. **[User Flow Name]**
   - Step 1: [Action] → [Expected result]
   - Step 2: [Action] → [Expected result]
   - Step 3: [Action] → [Expected result]
   - Validation: [Final state check]

**Example Flow:**
```
Password Reset Flow:
1. User requests reset → Email sent
2. User clicks email link → Token validated
3. User enters new password → Password updated and user logged in
4. Validation: Old password no longer works, new password works
```

### Layer 4: Performance Tests

<!--
  Test performance, scalability, and resource usage.
  Define benchmarks and acceptance criteria.
-->

**Performance Benchmarks:**

| Operation | Target | Acceptable | Unacceptable |
|-----------|--------|------------|--------------|
| API response time | < 100ms | < 200ms | > 500ms |
| Database query time | < 50ms | < 100ms | > 200ms |
| Concurrent users | 1000+ | 500+ | < 100 |
| Memory usage | < 256MB | < 512MB | > 1GB |

**Load Test Scenarios:**
1. **Normal Load**: [X] requests/second for [Y] minutes
2. **Peak Load**: [X] requests/second for [Y] minutes
3. **Stress Test**: Gradually increase load until system degrades

## Error Scenarios

<!--
  Explicitly test all error conditions defined in SPEC.md.
  Ensure error handling is robust and user-friendly.
-->

### Error Test Cases

1. **Invalid Input**
   - Missing required fields
   - Invalid data format
   - Out-of-range values
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request with descriptive error message

2. **Authentication Failures**
   - No auth token provided
   - Invalid or expired token
   - Expected: 401 Unauthorized

3. **Authorization Failures**
   - User lacks required permissions
   - Expected: 403 Forbidden

4. **Resource Not Found**
   - Non-existent resource ID
   - Expected: 404 Not Found

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Exceeded request limit
   - Expected: 429 Too Many Requests with retry-after header

6. **Server Errors**
   - Database connection failure
   - External service unavailable
   - Expected: 500 Internal Server Error (error logged, user gets generic message)

## Edge Cases

<!--
  Document and test unusual or boundary conditions.
-->

1. **[Edge Case Description]**
   - Condition: [When does this occur?]
   - Expected Behavior: [What should happen?]
   - Test: [How to verify?]

**Example Edge Cases:**
- Concurrent requests for same resource
- Very large input (boundary testing)
- Empty/null values in optional fields
- Unicode and special characters in text fields
- Timezone edge cases (midnight, DST transitions)

## Test Data Requirements

<!--
  Define what test data is needed and how to set it up.
-->

### Test Database
- Use separate test database
- Seed with known test data before each test suite
- Clean up after tests complete

### Test Users
- Standard user: [description and permissions]
- Admin user: [description and permissions]
- Restricted user: [description and limitations]

### Test Fixtures
```typescript
// Example fixture
const testUser = {
  id: 'test-user-123',
  email: 'test@example.com',
  role: 'user'
};
```

## Security Testing

<!--
  Define security-focused test cases.
-->

**Security Test Cases:**
- [ ] SQL injection attempts are blocked
- [ ] XSS attacks are prevented
- [ ] CSRF protection is active
- [ ] Sensitive data is not leaked in error messages
- [ ] Authentication cannot be bypassed
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Input validation prevents malicious payloads

## Testing Strategy

<!--
  Define when and how tests should be run.
-->

### Local Development
- Run unit tests on every file save (watch mode)
- Run integration tests before committing
- Run full test suite before pushing

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Run all tests on every pull request
- Block merge if tests fail
- Run performance tests on staging before production deploy
- Run security scans on dependencies

### Test Environments
- **Local**: Developer machines with mock external services
- **CI**: Automated test environment with test database
- **Staging**: Production-like environment for integration/e2e tests
- **Production**: Monitoring and synthetic tests (not full test suite)

## Test Maintenance

<!--
  Guidelines for keeping tests up to date.
-->

- Update tests whenever SPEC.md changes
- Remove obsolete tests when features are deprecated
- Refactor tests to reduce duplication
- Keep test data fixtures synchronized with schema changes
- Review and update performance benchmarks quarterly
