TEMPLATE USAGE GUIDE

1. Copy this file to your feature directory as README.md
2. Replace all [placeholder] values with your content
3. Delete sections marked "Delete if not applicable"
4. Keep HTML comments - they guide both humans and AI agents
5. Use the completion checklist at bottom to verify you're done
6. Update frontmatter status as you progress

TIPS FOR SUCCESS:
- Keep Purpose to ONE sentence (not "and" or compound statements)
- Write 1-3 user stories minimum
- Be specific, not vague (see examples in CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Link all related documents

REMEMBER: This documents an APPLICATION FEATURE - a discrete unit of functionality
that delivers value to end users or enables core business capabilities. Features are
what the application *does*, not how it's organized internally. See CONTRIBUTING.md
"What is a Feature?" section for full definition and examples.
