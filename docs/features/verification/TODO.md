## Blockers

**Current Blockers:** 0

No blockers. Feature is fully implemented and deployed.

---

## Decisions Made

### Decision: Use markdown report format

**Date:** Initial implementation
**Context:** Need human-readable verification reports that can be reviewed manually
**Decision:** Generate markdown reports with structured sections and markers
**Rationale:** Markdown is human-readable, easy to parse, and integrates well with documentation workflows
**Alternatives Considered:**

- JSON reports: Not human-readable, harder to review manually
- Plain text: Harder to parse reliably

### Decision: Three depth levels (quick, standard, deep)

**Date:** Initial implementation
**Context:** Users need to balance verification thoroughness with speed
**Decision:** Provide three preset depth levels with clear token budgets
**Rationale:** Simple abstraction that covers common use cases without exposing token counts to users
**Alternatives Considered:**

- Custom token budget: Too technical, users don't know how many tokens they need
- Binary (fast/thorough): Not granular enough

### Decision: Auto-verification with auto-resume

**Date:** Initial implementation
**Context:** Want to catch incomplete work automatically without manual intervention
**Decision:** Auto-verify on completion, auto-resume on failure with verification findings
**Rationale:** Reduces manual checking, ensures work is truly complete, provides feedback loop
**Alternatives Considered:**

- Manual verification only: Requires user to remember to verify
- Auto-verify without resume: Catches issues but doesn't fix them automatically

### Decision: Mode-aware verification prompts

**Date:** Initial implementation
**Context:** Loop mode and iterative mode have different expectations for progress tracking
**Decision:** Use mode-specific prompts via strategy pattern
**Rationale:** Ensures verification understands the mode's workflow and completion criteria
**Alternatives Considered:**

- Single generic prompt: Would miss mode-specific nuances
