## Implementation Progress

**Current Status:** Complete - All implementation tasks finished
**Progress:** 28/28 tasks completed (100%)

This is a brownfield documentation effort. The archives feature was implemented in v2.2.0 and is fully functional. This documentation captures the existing implementation.

### Tasks from PLAN.md

All tasks in PLAN.md are marked complete. Key implementation highlights:

#### Phase 1: Type Definitions ✓

- Created ArchiveMetadata Zod schema in src/types/archive.ts
- Defined all required fields with validation

#### Phase 2: Archive Manager Core ✓

- Implemented ArchiveManager class in src/core/archive-manager.ts
- Added tar package for tarball compression
- Used crypto.randomBytes for secure temp directories

#### Phase 3-8: Core Operations ✓

- Implemented archive(), listArchives(), restore(), getArchive(), delete(), exists()
- Added backwards compatibility for legacy directory format
- Implemented efficient metadata extraction (filter-based)

#### Phase 9: CLI Commands ✓

- Created all 5 CLI commands: save, list, restore, show, delete
- Added Logger integration with emoji indicators
- Implemented confirmation prompt for delete

#### Phase 10: Testing ✓

- Created comprehensive unit tests in tests/unit/archive-manager.test.ts
- Achieved ≥80% code coverage
- Tested all methods, error cases, and edge cases

## Decisions Made

### Decision: Use tarball format over directory format

**Date:** 2025-10-16 (v2.2.0 implementation)
**Context:** Original implementation used directory-based archives, which required multiple files and took more space.
**Decision:** Migrate to .tar.gz tarball format with embedded metadata.
**Rationale:**

- Single-file portability (easier to move/share)
- Gzip compression saves 60-80% space
- Industry standard format (tar)
- Efficient metadata extraction using tar filter feature
  **Alternatives Considered:**
- Keep directory format - rejected due to space inefficiency and multi-file complexity
- ZIP format - rejected due to tar being more Unix-native and better streaming support

### Decision: Embed metadata inside tarball

**Date:** 2025-10-16 (v2.2.0 implementation)
**Context:** Need archive metadata for listing operations without full extraction.
**Decision:** Include .archived.json file inside tarball, extract only that file for list operations.
**Rationale:**

- Self-contained archives (everything in one file)
- Tar supports efficient filter-based extraction
- No synchronization issues between archive and metadata
  **Alternatives Considered:**
- Separate metadata file alongside tarball - rejected due to two-file requirement and potential sync issues
- Encode metadata in filename - rejected due to filename length limits and special character issues

### Decision: Support legacy directory format

**Date:** 2025-10-16 (v2.2.0 implementation)
**Context:** Existing users may have directory-based archives from earlier versions.
**Decision:** Support both .tar.gz and directory formats in all operations (list, restore, show, delete).
**Rationale:**

- Backwards compatibility for existing users
- No forced migration required
- Graceful transition period
  **Migration Strategy:** New archives always created as tarballs, legacy archives continue to work

### Decision: Use crypto.randomBytes for temp directories

**Date:** 2025-10-16 (v2.2.0 implementation)
**Context:** Need unique temporary directories for concurrent operations.
**Decision:** Use `crypto.randomBytes(8).toString('hex')` for temp directory names.
**Rationale:**

- Cryptographically secure randomness prevents conflicts
- Unpredictable names prevent temp directory attacks
- Standard Node.js practice
  **Alternatives Considered:**
- Sequential counter - rejected due to race conditions
- Timestamp only - rejected due to insufficient uniqueness for concurrent operations

## Open Questions

No open questions. Feature is complete and functioning as designed.

## Implementation Notes

### Investigation Findings

**Similar Features:**

- Template management (src/commands/template.ts, src/core/template-manager.ts)
- Workspace management (src/commands/workspace.ts, src/core/workspace.ts)
- Both follow similar CLI patterns with Commander.js and Logger

**Dependencies:**

- ConfigManager: Provides archiveDir and workspacesDir paths
- Workspace management: Archives preserve workspace structure
- File utilities: Uses src/utils/fs.ts for all filesystem operations

**Testing Patterns:**

- Vitest framework with describe/it/expect
- Tests in tests/unit/ directory
- Coverage target ≥80% enforced
- beforeEach/afterEach for temp directory management
- Mock filesystem operations using Node.js tmpdir

**Code Patterns:**

- 2-space indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons required
- PascalCase for classes (ArchiveManager)
- camelCase for methods (archive, listArchives)
- Async/await for all filesystem operations
- try-finally blocks for temp directory cleanup

### Testing Coverage Report

**Current Coverage:** ≥80% (exact metrics in test output)

**Files Tested:**

- src/core/archive-manager.ts (100% method coverage)
- src/types/archive.ts (schema validation tested)

**Files Not Tested:**

- src/commands/archive.ts (CLI integration - future work)

**Future Testing Work:**

- Integration tests for CLI commands
- E2E tests for complete workflows
- Performance benchmarks for large workspaces
- Load testing for many concurrent operations
